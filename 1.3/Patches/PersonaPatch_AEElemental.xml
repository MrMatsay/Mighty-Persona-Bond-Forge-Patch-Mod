							<label>persona HZ Cryoblaster</label>
							<description>A somewhat heavy, unwieldy handheld cannon that launches canisters of highly compressed cryogas that explode on impact, instantly cooling the air to subzero temperatures and causing hypothermia as well as frostbite on unprotected targets. It is deployed sparsely on Urbworlds and Glitterworlds as an extreme means of controlling angry crowds due to its "non-lethal" but still quite painful nature.
			\n\nIt was built by the HALCYZOM Corporation over an unadvised bet after the company fridge broke, originally intended as a handheld design that could preserve food quickly and without loss in quality but subsequently over-engineered into the monstrosity it is today.
			\n\nIt is also endearingly monikered the "Cryo-Ass-Beater" due to an unfortunate incident involving a bystander's backside.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

							<description>A very heavy, finely machined firearm capable of shooting streams of highly energized plasma bolts at breakneck speeds. The plasma bolts are charged with dense ionized gas that can start fires and cause severe health side-effects.
	\n\nThe HZ Plasmabolter was originally designed as a scaled-down version of deep space mining implements that were usually found in mining spacecraft, and can quickly shear apart dense space material such as meteorites. 
	\n\nIt was briefly discontinued when several workers were afflicted with radiation poisoning from heavy usage of this tool, only to be put back in production when investors at HALCYZOM witnessed a squad of mercenaries use the tool to very effective results, only to be discontinued again when it was banned by every jurisdiction due to the lenghty list of war crimes HALCYZOM could be charged with for selling it, only to be then again put in production when it was rebranded once more as a mining implement that should never be used inside any planetary atmosphere lest the warranty become void.
	\n\nSuch is corporate life.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

							<label>persona HZ Homicide Applicator</label>
							<description>Unbeknownst to many perusers of HALCYZOM technology, they started out as an agricultural engineering firm, developing farming tools and implements, with a great focus on frontier developments on newly colonised rimworlds and midworlds. One of their first unique developments was a multi-function pesticide, herbicide, fungicide combo to deter the growth of blights and make crops more reliable, as well as a specialised tool to launch the poison great distances, to ease the workload of farmers and ranchers.
			\n\nLab testing proved the pesticide to be extremely effective at completely eliminating any potential pests. However, HALCYZOM's poor testing protocols never had the pesticide actually be tested on crops, or examine how it would affect people and livestock.
			\n\nThat said, HALCYZOM boasted a fantastic marketing team. The tool saw over a million sales in the first quarter, which was then followed by several high profile lawsuits as the pesticide compound completely eradicated millions of acres of crops, decimated livestock populations, causing millions to starve, as well as causing several chronic health problems and birth defects across a vast swath of their consumer base due to the lingering effects of the poison aerossol.
			\n\nHALCYZOM almost met their demise as a result of this incident. As a last resort, though, they bribed several high ranking government officials to officially rebrand themselves as a military service provider, putting their consumers at-fault for purchasing military implements without a proper license. And thus, HALCYZOM managed to rebrand this tool as the Homicide Applicator.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

							<description>A risky bid by HALCYZOM to try and enter the cleaning product market, the Problem Dissolver was originally meant to be a cleaning solvent to compete directly with Sir Spotless brand cleaning agent, stored in small pressurised tubes for easy application in even the tougher to reach spots. 
			\n\nNone of the engineers at HALCYZOM were hygiene specialists, however, they dramatically underestimated the strength of their solvent, and while the solvent was extremely effective at removing grime, unclogging drains and cleaning stains, it did so by also completely dissolving pipes, walls, floors, and even solid steel fixtures. 
			\n\nPoor quality testing before release meant that this problem was overlooked, and HALCYZOM was met with harsh criticism and several lawsuits from users who had lost a limb or two to the solvent, but managed to avoid the worst of it all by exploiting a loophole to claim they had always marketed the Problem Dissolver as a weapon.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

							<description>In her off-hours from HALCYZOM's research and development division, one scientist moonlighted as a particularly controversial DJ. Her need to blast the competition both figuratively and literally in a freestyle festival led her to develop the Sonic Shredder as a "portable acoustic amplifier" utilizing company resources.
			\n\nThe resulting mass homicide would have doomed the firm to such nebulous terms as "gross negligence" and "accomplice to multiple murders" were it not for savvy blue-collar wage slaves working 25/8 to rebrand it as a relatively "non-lethal" riot arms for professionals. To this day the Sonic Shredder is associated with law and order for the urbworlds that can afford it, instead of the LSD-fueled madness of its designer.
			\n\nIronically, some rappers have embraced the weapon as a crucial component of their productions, despite the multiple suits and injuries it tends to cause.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>
